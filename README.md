# Calculator App

Basic calculator app built in Java with a simple GUI using Java Swing. The project was inspired by Coding Challenges (https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-calculator/)

I utilised the shunting yard algorithm to convert the expression from infix to postfix (reverse polish) notation to make the logic easier to handle.

PLEASE note that the logic as is can only handle single digits :)

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

# Functionality

The project is built on Java and created a GUI using Java Swing. The calculator performs basic arithmetic operations.
